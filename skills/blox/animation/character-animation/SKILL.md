# Character animation with the `animate` tool

Start from the recipe closest to the request (`animate {action:"recipes"}`) and
change it. Run `check` before `build`: it validates the format, runs the motion
checks and returns a contact sheet image, without touching Studio. Pass
`locomotion: true` for a walk or run, and `grounded: true` for anything else
done standing on the ground, such as an idle: it fails when a foot sinks into
the floor.

## Loop

recipes → check {animation, locomotion?, grounded?, waive?} (look at the sheet;
fix, or waive a failure you mean, e.g. groundContact on a jump) → build {name}
→ a human runs `blox asset approve <name>` → asset {action:"upload",
id:"<name>", confirm:true} → wire {slot, asset} (idle, walk, run, jump, fall,
climb, swim, swimidle or sit) → verify {name, slot}.

Animations play only in places owned by the user or group that uploaded them.

## Format

```text
{ name, rig: "R15" | "R6", loop?, priority?, easing?, keyframes: [{ time, name?, easing?, joints: { <Joint>: pose }, markers? }] }
```

`waves` (a chain that sways) and `gait` (legs that walk), with `duration`,
can replace or join `keyframes`.

- Joints: `Root`, `Waist`, `Neck`, `LeftShoulder`, `LeftElbow`, `LeftWrist`,
  `RightShoulder`, `RightElbow`, `RightWrist`, `LeftHip`, `LeftKnee`,
  `LeftAnkle`, `RightHip`, `RightKnee`, `RightAnkle`.
- The first keyframe is at 0. A joint keyed in any keyframe must also be keyed
  in the first. A joint left out of a later keyframe just keeps moving toward
  its next key.
- A loop's last keyframe must repeat its first, so the loop joins up.
- A joint that turns more than 90° between two of its keys gets in-between
  keys added for it, along the short way round; the compiler counts them. Write a big swing as its key poses, not its arithmetic.
- The short way round must be the way you mean. A turn of 175° or more is
  refused, and a wide arc, such as an overhead slash that ends low on the
  other side, needs a key partway along it (the arm forward at the middle
  of the swing) so it goes over the top rather than through the body.
- Elastic and Bounce turns over 90° are not split: split them yourself.
- `easing` is `{ style, direction }`. Styles are Linear, Constant, Cubic,
  CubicV2, Elastic and Bounce; directions are In, Out and InOut. It can be set
  on a joint, a keyframe or the whole animation, and the nearest one applies.

## Markers

A keyframe's `markers` puts named events at its time, for scripts to time
gameplay to: the frame a sword hit lands, a footstep, a whoosh.

```text
{ time: 0.32, joints: {}, markers: [{ name: "Hit", value: "light" }] }
```

- A script listens with `track:GetMarkerReachedSignal("Hit")`; its handler
  receives `value` (a string, `""` when left out).
- A keyframe that only carries markers may key no joints: `joints: {}`.
- A keyframe's `name` is not a marker. It only fires the older
  `KeyframeReached` event, so use `markers` for anything a script waits on.

## Poses

Each pose takes one of these:

- `aim: [right, up, forward]` (shoulders and hips): the direction the upper arm
  or thigh points, seen from the character. `[0, -1, 0]` hangs it at rest,
  `[1, 0, 0]` holds the right arm straight out to the side, and `[0, -1, 0.4]`
  swings a leg forward. The vector does not need to be unit length.
- `bendToward: [right, up, forward]`, with `aim`: which way the elbow or knee
  folds. Leave it out to fold as at rest: arms forward, legs back. A raised
  waving arm folds up: `bendToward: [0, 1, 0]`.
- `bend: degrees` (elbows and knees): 0 is straight and 90 a right angle.
- `rotation: [x, y, z]` (any joint): degrees about the parent part's axes,
  applied as `CFrame.Angles` does. Use it for the torso, head, wrists and
  ankles. `Waist` at -X leans forward and at +X leans back. `Neck` at +X tips
  the head back. An ankle at +X lifts the toe.
- `position: [x, y, z]` (`Root` only): studs that offset the whole body.
  Negative y lowers the body, as a stride or crouch needs.

Prefer `aim` and `bend` for arms and legs. Working out a combined Euler rotation
by hand is where poses go wrong.

## Reaching a point: aimAt

`aimAt: [right, up, forward]` (shoulders and hips) puts the limb's end on a
point, in studs from the HumanoidRootPart's centre, however the body is posed
at that moment. Use it wherever a limb must meet something: a foot on the
ground,.

- On R15 the end is the wrist or the ankle, and the elbow or knee bends to
  reach it: `aimAt` keys the elbow or knee, so leave them out of that
  keyframe. On a leg it also keys the ankle, laying the foot flat, facing the
  way the body does.
- On R6, whose limbs cannot bend, the block points through the point: its end
  lands on it only when the point is exactly a limb's length away, and passes
  beyond it when nearer. Check R6 feet with `grounded: true`.
- `bendToward` turns the elbow or knee, as with `aim`.
- A point out of reach is refused, saying how far the limb reaches.
- **Planting.** A limb aimed at the same point in one of its keys and the next
  is planted there: the compiler solves it again every thirtieth of a second
  between them, so a foot stays within a few hundredths of a stud of its point
  while the body lunges, drops or turns over it, and keeps its heading. 
- To step, give the foot a different point, and lift it on a key between: a
  foot moved along the ground drags through it.
- Heights: the ground is 3.19 studs below the HumanoidRootPart's centre on
  R15 and 3 on R6. An R15 ankle stands 0.26 above the ground, so a planted
  R15 ankle is at `up` -2.93; an R6 leg's end is its sole, at -3.

## Recipes

Every recipe below compiles and passes every motion check. A unit test holds
each of them to that. Pass `locomotion: true` for walk and run, which turns on
the ground-contact, foot-sliding and gait-symmetry checks.

### Wave (loop)

```json
{ "name": "Wave", "rig": "R15", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "CubicV2", "direction": "InOut" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, 0.3, 0.4], "bendToward": [0, 1, 0] }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 70 } } },
  { "time": 0.3, "joints": { "RightElbow": { "bend": 115 } } },
  { "time": 0.6, "joints": { "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, 0.3, 0.4], "bendToward": [0, 1, 0] }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 70 } } }
] }
```

The upper arm holds still, out to the side and slightly forward. The forearm
swings between 70° and 115°. For a bigger wave, widen that range.

### Idle (loop)

```json
{ "name": "Idle", "rig": "R15", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "CubicV2", "direction": "InOut" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "Waist": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] }, "Neck": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [-0.08, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0.08, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 8 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 8 } } },
  { "time": 1.5, "joints": { "Waist": { "rotation": [3, 0, 0] }, "Neck": { "rotation": [-3, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [-0.14, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0.14, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 14 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 14 } } },
  { "time": 3, "joints": { "Waist": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] }, "Neck": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [-0.08, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0.08, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 8 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 8 } } }
] }
```

This is a slow breath. Keep idle motion small and slow: a few degrees over
seconds.

### Walk (loop, `locomotion: true`)

```json
{ "name": "Walk", "rig": "R15", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "Linear" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.09, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.92, 0.38] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [-11, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.98, -0.19] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [22, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.35] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.35] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 15 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 15 } } },
  { "time": 0.25, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.01, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.99, 0.11] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 12 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [6, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.76, 0.65] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 76 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [36, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 15 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 15 } } },
  { "time": 0.5, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.09, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.98, -0.19] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [22, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.92, 0.38] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [-11, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.35] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.35] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 15 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 15 } } },
  { "time": 0.75, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.01, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.76, 0.65] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 76 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [36, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.99, 0.11] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 12 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [6, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 15 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 15 } } },
  { "time": 1, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.09, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.92, 0.38] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [-11, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.98, -0.19] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 11 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [22, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.35] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.35] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 15 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 15 } } }
] }
```

The keys alternate between contact, with both feet down and the body lowered,
and passing, with the swing foot lifted under the body. Each arm swings against
its own side's leg. The ankles keep the planted foot flat. The body is lowered
at contact so that the straighter legs reach the ground without sinking into
it.

- To go faster, scale every time down.
- For a longer stride, raise the hips' forward and back aims together. Then
  lower `Root` a little more at contact, or the feet sink into the ground.

### Run (loop, `locomotion: true`)

```json
{ "name": "Run", "rig": "R15", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "Linear" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.18, 0] }, "Waist": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.82, 0.57] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 25 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.05] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 50 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [48, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.6] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.6] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 85 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 85 } } },
  { "time": 0.17, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.08, 0] }, "Waist": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.95, 0.3] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 33 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [16, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.63, 0.77] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 95 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [45, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 85 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 85 } } },
  { "time": 0.34, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.18, 0] }, "Waist": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.05] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 50 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [48, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.82, 0.57] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 25 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.6] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.6] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 85 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 85 } } },
  { "time": 0.51, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.08, 0] }, "Waist": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.63, 0.77] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 95 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [45, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -0.95, 0.3] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 33 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [16, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 85 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 85 } } },
  { "time": 0.68, "joints": { "Root": { "position": [0, -0.18, 0] }, "Waist": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -0.82, 0.57] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 25 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.05] }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 50 }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [48, 0, 0] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.6] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.6] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 85 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 85 } } }
] }
```

The run has the same structure as the walk, with these differences:

- a forward lean (`Waist` -10);
- a longer, lower stride;
- a higher knee lift;
- arms bent to 85° and swinging wider.

The knee lift stops at 95° from about 25°: a bigger lift reads as a sprint.

### Jump (one shot)

```json
{ "name": "Jump", "rig": "R15", "loop": false, "priority": "Movement", "easing": { "style": "CubicV2", "direction": "Out" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 0 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 0 }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 0 }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 0 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [0, 0, 0] } } },
  { "time": 0.12, "joints": { "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [-1, -0.2, 0.25] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, -0.2, 0.25] } } },
  { "time": 0.3, "joints": { "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [-0.5, 1, 0.2] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0.5, 1, 0.2] }, "LeftElbow": { "bend": 20 }, "RightElbow": { "bend": 20 }, "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.35] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.1] }, "LeftKnee": { "bend": 45 }, "RightKnee": { "bend": 25 }, "LeftAnkle": { "rotation": [-15, 0, 0] }, "RightAnkle": { "rotation": [-10, 0, 0] } } }
] }
```

The Humanoid does the jumping. The animation only poses the body in the air:
arms thrown up and knees tucked. The arms pass through the side at 0.12 s,
because going straight from down to overhead would be about half a turn, and
the key at the side says which way round the arms go.

## R6

Many places, combat games especially, give players R6 characters: six blocks
with no elbows, wrists, knees, ankles or waist. An R15 animation does not play
on them, so find which rig the players use before animating:

- Game Settings → Avatar (`StarterPlayer.GameSettingsAvatar`) says R6, R15 or
  player choice; `animate wire` reads it. A `StarterCharacter` in
  `StarterPlayer` decides it too. If players choose, make one animation per rig.
- `verify` refuses when the playtest character's rig is not the animation's.

Set `rig: "R6"`. Its joints are `Root`, `Neck`, `LeftShoulder`,
`RightShoulder`, `LeftHip` and `RightHip`, and they take poses in the
same terms as on R15: `aim` points an arm or leg the same way, and a
`rotation` turns about the same body axes. There is no `bend`: an R6 arm or
leg swings as one rigid block. The contact sheet draws the R6 blocks. Foot
sliding is reported as not checked for R6: its limit was set on R15 feet.

### Walk (R6, loop, `locomotion: true`)

```json
{ "name": "WalkR6", "rig": "R6", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "CubicV2", "direction": "InOut" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] } } },
  { "time": 0.4, "joints": { "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] } } },
  { "time": 0.8, "joints": { "LeftHip": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] }, "RightHip": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] }, "LeftShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, -0.4] }, "RightShoulder": { "aim": [0, -1, 0.4] } } }
] }
```

The legs swing as rigid pendulums, about 22° each way, with each arm against
its own side's leg. To go faster, scale the times down; for a run, widen the
swing and lean with `Root` `rotation`.

### Wave (R6, loop)

```json
{ "name": "WaveR6", "rig": "R6", "loop": true, "easing": { "style": "CubicV2", "direction": "InOut" }, "keyframes": [
  { "time": 0, "joints": { "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, 0.5, 0.2] } } },
  { "time": 0.35, "joints": { "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, 1.4, 0.2] } } },
  { "time": 0.7, "joints": { "RightShoulder": { "aim": [1, 0.5, 0.2] } } }
] }
```

With no elbow, the whole arm waves, raised out to the side and rocking up and
down. An R6 arm turns about the top of its inner edge, so one raised past the
shoulder brushes the head's block: keep the hand out to the side, not over
the head.

## Reading the result

- The contact sheet shows five evenly spaced moments, and a column for each
  named keyframe, each marker and the fastest instant, up to eight in all:
  the check result lists them. Name the keys that matter (`WindUp`, `Hit`) so a
  fast strike is always drawn. The top row is the front
  three-quarter. The bottom row looks straight at the front, where arm and head
  motion reads; for a gait (`locomotion: true`) it looks from the side, where
  strides and foot plants read.
- Check the pose against the request, not only the checks. The checks catch
  broken motion, but a pose can pass them and still not be the gesture that was
  asked for.
- Check and build the same `name` again to revise an animation. `build` refuses
  to replace a sequence edited in Studio since its build unless `force: true`.
